This February 14, join us for a day filled with joy, connection, and heartfelt moments! The morning kicks off with exciting Organizational Booths and a special CCC Hearts Day Talk, which is required for 1st and 2nd-year students but open to all City Collegians who wish to attend. In the afternoon, the celebration continues with the much-awaited Mr. & Ms. Cupid ‚Äì Teachers' Edition, followed by Especially for You, a segment full of surprises. Feel the warmth with our Open Ground Hug and spread kindness through Ribbon Giving, reminding everyone that love comes in many forms. To cap off the day, let Banda ni Kali serenade us with beautiful melodies in a heartwarming Harana. 

Don't miss this chance to celebrate love, friendship, and the spirit of CCC! üíñ‚ú®
